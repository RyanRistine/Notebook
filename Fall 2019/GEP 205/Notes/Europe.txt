    > Basic Concepts:
      > Nation:
        > A group of people with a sense of oneness
          > Don't necessarily have to have land to call their own
      > State:
        > a political unit that occupies a precisely defined, permanently
          populated territory
          > a state does not necessarily rule a people with a common culture
        > A part of the earth's land surface which is organized under a
          government and has boundaries
          > Refers to a legal/political entity that is comprised of the
            following: a) a permanent population a defined territory; c) a
            government; and d) the capacity to enter into relations with other
            states.
      > Nation-state:
        > refers to a nation which has its own political structure for the
          territory it occupies
        > Role of the Nation-State in previous time
          > Heavily regulated the migration of its citizens and labor processes
            > decided who to let in/out for what purpose and even when migrants
              expected to return
              > Mexico's Bracero program as an example
          > Managed a currency system
            > Capital flight now creates great challenges
              > The case of the Russian rubble
      > Multi-national state:
        > A state in which more than one nation resides
          > Iraq, USA, Spain, France
    > EU Demographic Crisis
      > Demography:
        > Study of populations and their characteristics, such as size, growth
          density, distribution, and other vital statistics
      > Fertility Rate in Europe is low, and life-expectancy is high
        > large population of people not contributing to taxes
      > EU identified demographic crisis as one of the largest challenges
        Europe will face in the 2020s
      > Population Change = Fertility - Mortality +/- Migration
      > Measuring population
        > Crude Birth Rate
          > Births/1000 individuals in a year
        > Crude Death rate
          > Deaths/1000 individuals in a year
        > Crude rates may be misleading
        > Rate of Natural Increase
          > CBR-CDR
            > If CBR>CDR population is growing
          > RNI != population growth if their is significant migration to/from
            the country
      > Demographic Situation in Europe
        > Aging population
        > Fallen fertility rate
          > in the early 2000s fertility rate stood 1.2 children per woman
            > far below the number needed to reproduce the population
          > The replacement fertility rate is roughly at 2.1 per woman in
           developed countries
  > 12-5
    > Causes of trends in Natural Change
      > Decline in death and birth rates
    > Population Pyramid
      > A graphical illustration that shows the distribution of various age
        groups in a population in the form of a pyramid
    > Demographic transition
      > is the transition from high birth and death rates to low birth and death
        rates as a country develops from a pre-industrial to an industrialized
        economic system.
    > Policy Options
      >1
        > Encourage higher TFR/BR
        > Pro Family supports
          > cash bonuses, tax relief
        > Positive Experiences
          > Sweden, Finland
      > 2
        > Obtain greater productivity from exiting population
          > raise employment rates within population
          > improve education/skill levels
          > Raise retirement age
          > Integrate marginal minority groups
      > 3
        > Migration
          > currently the big issue for EU
          > reconcile if migration is a solution or problem
          > EU policymakers see immigration as a benefit due to immirants 
          > advocate targeting not 'open door'
            > Young skilled immigrants
            > more effective integration
