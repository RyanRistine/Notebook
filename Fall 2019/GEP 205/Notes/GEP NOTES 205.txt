  >Thomas Theorem
      > If you define something as real then it becomes real
      > Race is an example of this, those who have power are the ones who make
        it real

      > Those in power define groups of people in a certain way that depends on
        a racist social culture
          > White people & Native Americans (Trail of Tears, etc.)
      > dominate vs subordinate isn't defined by numbers but by Power
        > numbers != power
> Legal Definition of Race
  > Alabama and Arkansas defined anyone with one drop of "negro" blood
          as Black; Florida had a one-eighth rule; Georgia referred to
          "ascertainable" non-White blood; Indiana used a one-eighth rule;
           Kentucky relied on a combination of any "appreciable mixture" of
           Black ancestry and a one-sixteenth rule

              is just a social construct

      test for a Mexican"
