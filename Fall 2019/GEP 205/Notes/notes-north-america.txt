      > Geography:
        > Interdisciplinary field
          > Focuses on understanding relationships between people, groups,
            places.
        > Study of spatial variations that exist amongst regions, places,
          landscapes, and environments and seeks to understand the forces that
          make these areas different.

      >Scale:
        > National
        > Regional
        > Local

      > "If you don't know where you're going geography can take you there"

      > Commodity: Something we use & consume and add value to

      > Perception of everything changes from culture to culture; from region to
        region

      > Economy can mean many things:
        > American Economy focusing on money
        > Others focus on sharing
          > "Economy of affection"

      > Landscape:
        > Class, racial geography, etc.

      > Globalism:
        > All places can be interconnected

      > Food Security
        > dependent on access, not possession
          > Ethiopia had a famine because they didn't have enough food to both
            pay the British and feed themselves.
          > Some of the most impoverished places have the most agriculture but
            least access.

      > Historical Development
        > Developed as a colonial field
          > at the center of European colonialism depriving some regions of
            resources.
              > Facilitated exploitation of resources in Africa, Latin America,
                and Asia.

      > Eurocentric
        > Focus on Europe

      > Decolonization of Africa
        > Started in 1950s
        > Boundaries created artificially
          > as a result, over 300 groups in Nigeria

      > Dominant/majority and Subordinate/Minority
        > Not necessarily based on numbers, instead based on power of group

                  > All countries benefit from Globalization
                    > Claims that globalization defines a new epoch of human
                      history in which the traditional nation-states has become
                      unnatural
                    > The world is moving towards a global market and global
                      prices

                      the international system
                      > The key factors become the transnational corporation
                        > A more complex economic system emerged
                > Skeptics
                  > Globalization doesn't benefit developing countries
                    > Current international economy is not fully open and

                          retard the economic growth of poor countries,
                          specially in Africa
                    > Labor, as a crucial economic factor remains relatively
                      immobile compared to capital
                  > Emphasize the enduring power of national governments not
                    necessary MNCs
                    > Role of states is crucial role in facilitating the
                      process of economic interaction at the global scale
                      > Can't leave it to MNCs to protect social economic
                        well-being

                  > sees globalization as a powerful transformative force
                    > is responsible for a massive shake out of societies,
                      different traditions, economies, institutions of
                      governance, and world order
                  > The direction of globalization remains uncertain
                    > there is no certainty of where globalization might be
                      leading to and the kind of world order that might emerge
                      as a result
                  > Also Emphasizes the continuation of global divergence and
                    differences among and within countries
        > A process or set of processes which embodies a transformation in the
          spatial organization of social relations and transactions, generating
          transcontinental or interregional flows and networks of activity,
          interaction and power.

      > Region
        > Defined as a grouping of similar places or places with similar
          characteristics
          > a "spatial stereotype"
            > E.G. The Caribbean ( White sand Beaches)
          > Helps organize information, compressing it into units of spatial
            similarities
            > Through regions, geographers explore how and why places alike or
              different
            > What makes regions different
          > Geography investigates differences among & within Regions

          > Formal Region
            > Region w/ 2 or more similar attributes
              > language, income, religion, elevation, climate, agricultural
                crop, etc.

          > Functional Region
            > Unified by an activity such as economic or Political
              > e.g. America's Corn Belt
                > organized around a focal point * is tied to central point by
                transportation, economics, and political or communication
                systems
              > defined by a system of interactions
            > Examples
              > DFW is a functional region because the two cities are linked by
                the airport
              > Cocaine Networks are functional regions
          > Vernacular or Perceptual Region
            > A place people believe exists as part of their cultural identity
              > A perceptual region is defined by people's feelings and
                attitudes about an area
                  > ex. The Midwest; the periphery etc.
              > Are more likely than other kinds of regions to change over time
              > Are also frequently based on stereotypes, influenced by travel,
                media, reading, films, and conversations
            > Ex. The Rust Belt
        > Why Region?
          > Regions are part of human creations:
            > Used to manage and interpret the complexities of the earth's
              surface
            > Helped us understand and recognize the arrangements of people,
              places and environment
                > Our lives are structured within regions

      > Mobility
        > Is a concept used to understand variation and the rapid changes around
          the world, whether in culture, politics, race, language, etc...
          > Helps geographers understand how and why different cultural elements
            move through space and locate in particular setting.
            > for instance: How do people happen to speak Kreyol in Haiti.
        > At the center of Colonialism, Migration
          > When people migrate, they bring their cultures with them
            > Food, religion, music, clothes, customs, language
            > culture is learned
        > Important to Mobility: Migration
          > Migration is the movement of people from one area to another for the
            purpose of taking up permanent or semi-permanent residence, usually
            across a political boundary
        > Outcomes of Mobility and Migration
          > Cultural Markers
            . Structures or artifacts that reflect the cultures and histories of
              those who constructed or occupied them
          > Diffusion (Five main types)
            > Relocation diffusion
              > People with particular ideas/practices migrating from one area
                to another
                  > Political Ideas, Economical Ideas, etc.
            > Expansion diffusion
              > Ideas and practices spread from one point to other areas of a
                population
            > Hierarchical diffusion
              > When Idea begins from a core point to peripheral areas; or from
                one important person to those of lesser importance
              > Sometimes the inverse happens; bottom up changes
                > I.E. Arab Spring
            > Contagious diffusion
              > A type of diffusion in which ideas spread by person to person
                similar to diseases
                  > Hierarchical and contagious diffusion often times reinforce
                    each other
            > Stimulus diffusion
              > When only part of a culture is taken elsewhere and adapted

                life
              > Beginning with Industrial Revolution in Europe and North
                America, greenhouse gases have increased dramatically, mostly
                from burning fossil fuels

              one another, causing the major topographic features of Earth (e.g.
              Mountains , oceans) and most earthquakes and volcanoes
