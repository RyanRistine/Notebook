  > Basic Loops
    > Loop
      > A contiguous block of code that can be executed multiple times
    > Iteration
      > The act of repeating OR an individual execution of a loop
        ("this loop has xxx iterations")
    > Definite Loop
      > A loop that runs for a specified number of iterations

    > ----------------------------- Example of Loop
      | for <var> in <iterator>:  |
      |   <body>                  |
      -----------------------------
      > <var> is a variable, called the loop index, and can be anything;
        usually i or j are used.
        > a fresh variable, just a counter, used only in for loop
      > <iterator> is a list of values that you want to go through;
        can be numbers, strings, list, etc.
        > Uses zero indexing
        > can be range(x), range(x,y), [lists], <var>, range(x,y,z), etc.
          > range (x,y)
            > will contain x->(y-1)
              > for i in range(1,11) | This outputs
                  print(i)           | 1-10
          > range (x,y,z)
            > start point, end point, step
      > <body> contains the code needed to be repeated and often includes
        reference to the loop index
