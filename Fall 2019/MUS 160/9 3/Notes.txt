      changes over time
  > How Music Lives
    > Sample questions to consider when listening
      > What are the structural elements to consider?
        > Theory Analysis
      > Who wrote this music and why?
      > What cultures, identities, and traditions does this music draw upon?
      > How does the music reflect the cultural context in which it was created?
      > How was this music created?
      > Who listens to this music and why?
      > What functions does the music serve?
      > What various meanings does the music have for its performers,
        composers, audiences, and critics?
      > How were the musicians compensated for the music, if at all? How is
        the music consumed?
      > Don't** focus on if you like it/ if it is good or bad
        > More focus on critical listening skills
    > Ethnomusicology
       > Study of music in culture
       > Interdisciplinary field that draws on musicology, anthropology, and
          other disciplines to study the world's musics.
       > Traditionally separate from musicology
       > Incorporates fieldwork: Living for an extended period of time among
         the people whose lives and music one researches and often learning and
         performing their music as well.
    > Culture
      > "That complex whole which includes knowledge, beliefs, art, law, morals,
        custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a
        member of society" -(Edward Tylor, 1871)
    > Musicologists study sounds and cultures
      > sounds like:
        >  particular sequence of notes and rhytms
        > a warao shaman's song with a particular melodic direction
        > a particular vocal quality of singing (I.e. Chinese Opera)
        > a particular sequence of five or seven Notes
          > (scales/modes)
      > What it means:
        > The song Mary had a little lamb
        > A song with power to cure vs. one with power to cause illness
        > An aesthetic beauty to fans of Chinese opera, but maybe not to others

            > In Bali from town to town there can be different styles of
              music and different cultures of music
    > Culture vs Society
      > Defining a specific culture, vs defining "culture" as a broader concept
