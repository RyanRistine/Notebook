# Are Extra-Solar Planets Common?

## Detection is a modern occurrence
  * until the mid-late 90s was the beginnings, only a few detected
  * 2011 ~500
  * 2013 765 planets confirmed to be discovered, with 2300 candidates
  * 2019 5000 confirmed, 3000 candidates
  * Confirmed "earth-like" planets: ~60

## "If you see a star in the sky, it probably has planets"
  * Planets are the rule, not the exception
  * usually more than 1 or 2 planets per star

## Kepler discoveries
  * Gas Giants getting too close to their star and getting ripped apart
  * Planets around Binary star systems (tatooine)
  * Planets in the Habitable zone, (earth-like)
  * Systems that have large numbers of planets, 20 planets in a system, 8 planets in the habitable zone

## What is "earthlike"
  * not to big not too small
  * not too hot not too cold (based on proximity to star)
  * not at a point that we can start sub-categorizing
    * currently "super earth" is a sub-category, basically means a planet that is 2x size of earth of larger
    * when JWST comes online, it will be able to help sub-categorize, as it has the ability to scan the makeup of the atmosphere of exoplanets
  * Venus is technically "Earthlike" based on how we categorize it
    * is about the same size
    * based on distance to star it "should" be only a bit warmer than earth
      * we know that in actuality it is hotter because of its atmosphere, the categorization "earthlike" does not take atmosphere into account because until JWST launches we can't measure that in exoplanets that have been discovered

## Europa could maintain life
  * Icey "surface" with massive liquid water ocean beneath
  * All the "building blocks" of life are present in Europa's ocean
  * Could be one of the best candidates for sustaining life in the solar system


# Methodology and Results

## How do we detect and measure planets around other stars and their properties
  * They're small and far away which is a challenge with many aspects of astronomy
  * can't be detected directly by current technology
    * "like trying to detect a candle which is backlit by a stadium light"
    * detected by observing the star, rather than observing the planet itself

### Radial Velocity/Doppler Method
  * Older, first few detections
  * how far something is moving, relative to you
  * measuring physical, cyclical movement of the star, because of the planet
    * Gravity works in both directions - the mass of the planet causes the star to wobble as it orbits, the stars' light is doppler shifted
  * through this method we can determine a planet's
    * mass
    * Orbital Period
    * distance from its parent star
  * is inherently biased
    * this method only allows you to detect big planets that are very close to their star
  * Tells mass and what temperature "should be"

#### Doppler shift
  * Change in the way something sounds, as its moving
    * wavelength of sounds is compressed and expanded
    * same thing happens with light
      * as light source moves toward you, light turns "bluer"
      * as light source moves away from you, light turns "redder"

### Transit Method
  * Transit Photometry - measuring the change in brightness of a star as a planet transits in front of it
    * detecting light that is blocked by a planet transiting across a star, rather than light that is reflected
  * Is much more efficient, because you can monitor thousands of stars at a time
  * Tells the size of the planet

### Methods combined
  * can determine size, mass, and temperature
    * whether or not a planet is "Earthlike"
  * Both biased towards large Planets
  * hard to confirm anything as we haven't been watching long enough to observe multiple periods of planets that are further from the star than earth, planets that take 10+ years to orbit have at most 1 observed "dip"

### Kepler Telescope
  * Launched in 2009 - purpose built telescope for finding and monitoring exoplanets
  * Uses the Transit Method to monitor over 100,000 stars
  * predecessor to new telescope, Gaia

## Solar Systems similar to ours exist
  * Upsilon Andromedae
    * muli-planet system, has planets much larger than Earth and larger than Jupiter, which are "Earthlike"
