Worksheet Lab 1 - Ryan Ristine
1. Running the command "echo -e 'Hello\nWorld'"
will output the phrase "Hello World" with a new
line between Hello and World.

The -e option allows for interpretation of
backslash escapes

the "\n" creates a new line between "Hello" and
"World"

When the single quotes are removed the command
prints "HellonWorld", the new line is not
interpreted

2.date -u

3. the hostname command is used to set or view
your system's hostname

output on the temp lab server is "lab01"

output when not on the temp server is the
name of my machine, "Ryan-Ristine-Laptop"

adding the -i option prints the machine's ip
address instead of the name

4. echo -e 'Hello\nWorld'
