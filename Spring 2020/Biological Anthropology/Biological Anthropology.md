  * Biological Anthropology
    * How human biology developed
    * Diversity of modern human Biology
    * Based on Evolution

### What is Culture?

  * A set of learned behavior traditions
  * Ways of behaving valuing and thinking
    * Socially transmitted and learned
  * Possessed by other animal species

### Evolution

  * A change in the frequency of a particular trait, and the genes that
    control it, from one generation to the next.

### Scientific Method

#### A process, not a result

  * Questions that can be repeated and verified by experimentation
  * 4 basic steps
    * observation
    * hypothesis formation
    * experimentation and data collection
    * conclusion

### Scientific Theory

  * A hypothesis supported by lots of observation and experimentation
  * Most widely accepted, plausible explanation
  * Science as self*correcting
  * Example: Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection

### Human Origins: Competing explanations

  * Creationism or Intelligent Design vs Evolution
    * Creationism vs Intelligent Design
      * Creationism: Bible story, no evolution
      * Intelligent Design: Evolution was directed by God
    * Valid religious beliefs but can't be tested or proven by science

    * Source of natural variation: God
      * Creation story in Bible
    * Static natural order: "fixity of species", unchanging Earth
    * Archbishop Ussher (1650)
      * Genealogies in Bible
      * Date of Creation: Oct 22, 4004 B.C.
        * This is where the 6000 number comes from
    * From the 1750s on: change became conceivable

     * Hierarchal placement of animals into descending categories based on
       shared features
       * Categories get more and more specific as they descend
    * Binomial nomenclature:
     * Genus Species
       * Humans are Homo Sapiens
       * Gorillas are Gorilla Gorilla

     * Changes acquired in each generation are passed down to the next
  * Charles Lyell (1797*1875)
    * Earth as dynamic
     * Theory of uniformitarianism
       * Natural laws are constant
       * Change usually occurs slowly and steadily
       * Change is non-progressive
  * Charles Darwin (1809-1882)
    * Co-developer with Alfred Russel Wallace of the theory of evolution
      by Natural Selection
    * Friendship with John Edmonstone

      * Inspired by stories of South American flora and fauna
    * Darwin went on a voyage to chart the South American coastline
     * H.M.S. Beagle from 1831*1836
       * Darwin collected plant and animal samples
         A. This was his first visit to the Galapagos Islands

### The Cellular and molecular basis for evolution

  * Genetics: The source of variability for Evolution
    * Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection:
      * adaptation, variation, reproductive fitness
  * The goal of genetics
    * Understand how genes interact with each other and with the environment to produce complex organisms.
    * Genetic expression occurs at multiple levels:
     * Cells and Molecules
     * Individuals
     * Populations and species
  * Cells: "The fundamental building blocks of all life"
    * Each human is originally one cell:
     * 23 chromosomes from each parent
  * Types of cells in the human body
    * Gametes: Sex cells
     * Ovum in Females
     * Sperm in Males
    * Somatic cells: almost all cells except gametes
    * Stem Cells
  * Prokaryotes vs. Eukaryotes
    * Prokaryotes:
     * all single celled organisms
     * no compartments in cell
    * Eukaryotes:
     * All multicellular organisms
     * Compartments: DNA is separate
  * Anatomy of a Eukaryotic Cell
    * Nucleus: contains DNA
    * RNA: 3+ types; help with protein synthesis
    * Mitochondria: ~~powerhouse of the cell~~
     * energy metabolism, have own DNA
       * Mitochondrial DNA is only passed down maternally
    * Ribosomes: where protein synthesis happens
  * DNA can:
    * Replicate itself
    * Be Inherited
    * Code for protein synthesis

### DNA Structure I: The molecular level

#### Double Helix

  * James Watson and Francis Crick and Rosalind Franklin
    * Rosalind used x-ray crystallography to see structure of molecules
     * Saw a cool picture of DNA structure
    * Her work was shown to Watson and Crick and they got credit for the
      discovery

#### Deoxyribonucleic Acid

  * Backbones: sugar and phosphate molecules
  * Rungs: 2 nucleotides
    * Nucleotide:
     * one sugar, one phosphate, one base

### DNA Function I: Replication

  * Triggered by enzymes
  * Unravels into single strands
  * Free*floating bases join on
  * 1 original strand + 1 new strand = 2 copies of the original "mother"
    DNA
  * Replication errors: mutations

### DNA Function II: Protein Synthesis

#### Proteins

  * Complex molecules
  * Functions:
    * Structure
    * Transport
    * Immune System
    * Enzymes
  * 2 million+

##### Protein Structure

  * Amino acids
  * linked by peptide bonds to form Polypeptide chains

##### Protein Function

  * Genes determine characteristics of polypeptide chains:
    * length
    * number
    * composition

##### Gene

  * Sequence of DNA bases
  * Recipe of one polypeptide chain

##### Genetic Code

  * Codons (3 bases)
    * One Amino Acid
  * 64 codons for 20 amino acids:
    * redundancy

##### Protein Synthesis

  * RNA:
    * Single helix
    * Can leave nucleus
     * Messenger RNA (mRNA)
     * Transfer RNA (tRNA)
  * DNA unravels
  * One strand picked up by mRNA
  * mRNA takes transcribed genetic code from nucleus to ribosomes, where
    translation occurs
  * tRNA brings amino acid for each codon, forming a polypeptide chain
  * Transcription vs Translation
    * Transcription:
     * Nucleus
     * mRNA
    * Translation:
     * Ribosome
     * tRNA

### DNA Structure II: Chromosomes

  * How is DNA packaged in the nucleus?
    * Chromosomes
     * Threads of tightly coiled DNA
  * Human chromosomes
    * Somatic cells: 46 chromosomes
     * 22 pairs of homologous chromosomes (#1*22)
     * 1 pair of sex chromosomes XX or XY
     * Diploid
    * Gametes: 23 Chromosomes
     * 1 female gamete + 1 male gamete = 2X23 pairs = 46 chromosomes
     * Haploid

### Genes and alleles

* Gene: "recipe" for one polypeptide chain
* Sequence of bases at one point on DNA, on one chromosome
* Allele: possible variants of a gene
* Homozygous:
  * Same allele for a gene on each chromosome
* Heterozygous:
  * different alleles for a gene on each chromosome

#### How is genetic information inherited?

* We are originally one cell...
* if somatic cells have 46 chromosomes how do gametes end up with only 23?
* MEIOSIS
* How do we grow from one cell into us?
* MITOSIS

#### Mitosis

* "Ordinary" division of somatic cells
* 1 diploid somatic cell -> 2 identical *diploid* **somatic** cells

##### Mitosis: cell cycle

* DNA replicates into double-stranded chromosomes, which migrate to center of cell

* Chromosome split and go to opposite ends of cell

* ##### Nuclei reassemble around 2 new "daughter" cells

#### Meiosis

* 1 diploid **somatic cell** -> 4 unique (as opposed to mitosis when they're not unique) *haploid* **Gametes**
* More specialized than mitosis

##### Meiosis: Cell Cycle

* Also begins with DNA replication, but...
* 1. Cells split *twice* -> 4 daughter cells, each with only *one* chromosome
  2. Before cell division, double stranded chromosomes link up into pairs

##### Meiosis: crossing over

* Chromosomes get tangled -> exchange sections of DNA
* Result: new hybrids
* Chromosome pairs no longer "match"
* Result: 4 unique chromosomes = 4 unique gametes
* Every time
* Key to genetic variation

|                      | Mitosis                 | Meiosis           |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------- |
| Cell Division Events | 1                       | 2                 |
| Result               | 2 diploid somatic cells | 4 haploid gametes |
| Same?                | Yes                     | No                |

#### Chromosomal Abnormalities

* Nondisjunction errors:
  * Chromosomes don't segregate properly into gametes during meiosis

##### Nondisjunction errors: Monosomy

* One chromosome in a pair is absent
* Turner syndrome

##### Nondisjunction error: Trisomy

* one extra chromosome
* Down Syndrome: three (vs. 2) copies of Chromosome 21

#### The Human Genome Project

* April 2003: entire human genome sequenced
* 3 billion bases
  * we're less complex than wheat, which has 17 Billion
* 25,000 genes
  * same number as mice, less than some plants (like wheat, our new overlords)
* Each chromosome contains hundreds or thousands of genes
* 99.9% of each human's DNA is identical to that of every other human.
* What do we do with this knowledge?
* Only about 15% codes for protein synthesis
  * the rest is structural

##### Genetic testing: Ethical Considerations

* Advances in biomedical research
* Privacy concerns

## Chapter 4

### Learning Objectives
* What is the difference between an individual's genotype and their phenotype?
  * How do monogenetic traits, polygenic traits, and pleiotropy represent
    various relationships between them
* Explain Mendel's laws of dominance, segregation, and independent assortment,
  Which one does a Punnett square demonstrate?
* Differentiate between point, insertion, and deletion mutations
  * How is sickle cell anemia an example of a point mutation?
* Why do X-linked disorders seem to appear only in males?

#### Mendelian and Post-Mendelian Genetics
* Genotype: Each organism's set of genetic material
* Phenotype: physical manifestations of genes, observable trait
  * Anatomical
  * Biochemical
  * Behavioral
##### Different relationships between genotypes and phenotypes
* One or multiple genes can code for one phenotypic trait
* Complex phenotypes: interaction between genotype and environment    
* ABO Blood type system:
  * One Gene codes for one phenotypic trait
    * Three Alleles: A, B, O
    * O == Recessive: two copies required (homozygous)
    * A, B: Dominant: only one copy required (homo- or heterozygous)
    * Co-dominant: Two different alleles are both expressed
##### Gregor Mendel (1822-1884)
* Austrian monk
* Plant breeding experiments: common garden pea
* Quantitative approach
  * Really the first one to approach it like this, took lots of notes
* Mendel's Experiments
  * Founding population (F^0): one yellow, one green
  * F1 (first generation): All Yellow
  * F2: three yellow, one green
  * Yellow = dominant
  * green = recessive
  * Law of dominance
##### Monogenic traits: only two variants
* observing phenotype to figure out genotype
##### Law of Segregation
* Chromosomes segregate independently and randomly
* Either of the chromosomes in a pair is equally likely to be inherited
* Punnett square
  * DOMINANT ALLELE
  * recessive allele
##### Law of independent assortment
* Pairs of Chromosomes assort independently
* The segregation of one pair does not influence the segregation of another pair
  in the same gamete
* Genes on same chromosome: Linked
  * more likely to cross over together
    * For example Hair/Eye Color often being inherited together
      * explains prevalence of blonde hair blue eyes && Brown hair brown eyes
  * assortment isn't always independent
* Genes on different chromosomes: unlinked

#### Three Types of Mutations
* Point
* insertion
* Deletion

##### Point Mutation
* a single base pair in the DNA sequence is changed
* Sickle Cell Disease
  * Red blood cells deliver oxygen to body tissues
  * Hemoglobin (Protein)
    * Four chains, two alpha and two beta (two unlinked genes)
  * Point mutation on beta chain results in sickle cell trait
  * Sickle cell attacks:
    * RBC distorts after oxygen is dropped off
      * "traffic jam"
      * Can cause pain and swelling in joints and extremities
  * repeated sickling damages RBCs and shortens their life span -> anemia
  * High frequencies of sickle cell trait == High occurrences of Malaria
    (special extra deadly malaria)
    * adaptive in these environments!
      * somehow protects against super extra deadly Malaria

##### Punnett Squares
| --- |HbA      | HbS     |
| HbA | HbA/HbA | HbA/HbS |
| HbS | HbA/HbS | HbS/HbS |

* If both parents carry one copy of recessive, there's a 25% child will be born
  with recessive trait

#### Insertion Mutation
* Addition of one or more base pairs
##### Huntington's Disease
* Huntington: repeated insertion of 40+ CAGs

#### X-Linked Disorders
* Mutation on the X Chromosomes
* Appear in males and then seem to "skip" a generation
* Examples: hemophilia, Fragile X syndrome, red-green color blindness
* Male sufferers can only pass mutation on to daughters

##### Hemophilia A
* Absence of a blood clotting protein (factor VIII)
* Allows hemorrhaging
* Gene therapy unsuccessful so far
* Hemophilia B: Royal families of Europe:
  * Victoria, Romanovs

### Monogenic Traits
* One gene -> one phenotypic trait
* you either have it or you don't

### Polygenic Trait
* Multiple genes -> one phenotypic trait
* most of our traits
* Distribution: Bell shaped curve
* examples: eye color, hair color, face shape etc.

### Pleiotropy
* One gene -> multiple phenotypic traits
* Example achondroplasia (dwarfism)

### Complex phenotypes
* The influence that genotype and environment each have on phenotype is measured in terms of
	* Heritability
	* Ranges from 0-1

### Twin method
* Estimates heritbaility by comparing concordance rates of indentical twins (MZ - Mono-zygote) and Fraternal twins (DZ)
* How often dotwins exhibit the same phenotypic trait?
	* MZ = 100%, DZ = 66%

### California Autism Twins Study
* Concordance rates:
	* 70% MZ, 35% DZ
* 3-14% chance for different age siblings
* Environment unique to twins

### Endocrine Disruptors
* Found... everywhere
* DES
	* vaginal/breast cancer in daughters
* PFOA
	* Obesity in daughters

### Congeital changes to male reproductive anatomy
* Hypospadias
* Bisphenol A
* "BPA Free"?

### Eugenics
* Francis Galton (1883) - "future betterment of the human race"
* positive eugenics
* negative eugenics
* California's role
* "war on the weak"

## Chapter 5 - 2/11

* Give an example of gene flow
* Describe hor founder effets and a genetic bottlenecks are examples of genetic drift
* What are the different roles of males and females in sexual selection? How does it affect sexual dimorphism in a species?

* What is a species, according to the biological species concept?
* Is anagenesis or cladogenesis more responsible for the diversity of life on earth, and why?
* How do geographic barriers cause allopatric speciation?

### Definitions:
* Evolution: A change in the frequency of a trait, and the genes that control it, from one generation to the next.
	* Evolution
* Five evolutionary forces
	* mutation
	* Natural selection
	* gene flow
	* genetic drift
	* sexual selection
#### Mutation
* *Increases Variation*
* Mutations during DNA replication are compounded by crossing over
* Each offspring born qith a unique combo of parents' DNA

#### Natural Selection
* *Reduces Variation*
* Can select *for* helpful mutations **OR** *against* harmful mutations
* Environment selects for/against phenotypic traits (and the genes that control them)
*  Types of Natural Selection
	* Directional: Selects for greater or lesser frequency of a trait in a population
	* Stabilizing: Maintains a phenotype by selecting against outliers
* Individuals vs. Populations
	* Natural selection operates on *individuals'* phenotypes
	* Causing *populations* to evolve
#### Gene Flow
* *Reduces* **OR** *increases* Variation
* "Genetic Baggage" of migration
* Genetic Drift
	* *reduces* Variation
	* Random changes in allele frequencies in a population
		* For example: Natural Disasters, or varying birthrates - can be solved by eating the old
		* Founder effect: Small segment of population splits off from original founder population, taking with them a random sample of genes, stays reproductively isolated
		* Geographically isolated populations
			* Pitcairn Island: So, so inbred, jesus fuck they're inbred, it's like an Alabama orgy but with only 9 grandparents
		* Socially isolated populations
			* Amish
		* Genetic Bottleneck: Large population reduces, and then it increases
			* Natural disaster occurs, reduces gene pool, then population regrows, but from this new smaller gene pool
			* Post-bottlneck population has much less genetic diversity
			* Examples: Elephant Seals in California, Cheetahs
#### Evolutionary Forces on humans
* Gene flow and genetic drift:
	* Powerful in small populations of hominin ancestors
* Fewer traits due to natural selection than previously thought
#### Sexual Selection
* Differential fitness among members of same sex within a species
* Females choose carefully
* Male traits that enhance reproductive success are elaborated
	* Elaborate male traits signal underlying genetic quality
	* Males show off and compete
* Sexual Dimorphism
	* Differences in size, shape, or color between the sexes
	* Result of male-male competition and importance of female choice
### Systemic Classification
* Organisms grouped by similarities due to common ancestry
* Homologous Traits: Similar because of shared ancestry
* Analogous Traits: Similar because of convergent evolution (different ancestry)
* Ancestral Traits: Retained from ancestral species
* Derived Traits: Evolved since last ancestral species
	* Based on *Derived Traits*, Systematists create a phylogeny
#### What is a species?
* The smallest taxonomic unit in a classification
* The only taxonomix unit that can be objectively defined (???)
* Species are *dynamic*
##### Biological Species Concept
* An interbreeding natural population
* Reproductively isolated from other such populations
	* Only find reproductive success with members of their own species; to our knowledge humans fit this definition
	* "Closed Reproductive Entity"
		* Reproductive isolating mechanisms
##### Speciation
* Appearance of new species from an ancestral population
* Always ongoing
* Speciation ending
	* Example: Fertile mules - occuring through non-disjunction errors
* Two broad patterns:
	* Anagenesis
		* Slow, gradual evolution of same population (linear)
		* For example: Giant sloths went through an anagenetic process to become the tree sloths we have today
	* Cladogenesis
		* one ancestral species evolves into 2 or more descendant species (branching)
		* barriers
		* Evolutionary Forces?
		* For example: Chimpancestors 2 populations got seperated on different sides of the Congo river, one evolved into modern chimpanzees the other evolved into modern Bonobos, very similar but there are distinct differences.
* Three specific processes
	* *Allopatric speciation*
	* Parapatric speciation
	* Sympatric speciation

## Chapter 6

### Learning Objectives

* What makes a gene or trait polymorphic
* How does marternal-fetal incompatibility work against the blood type
* Explain how heterozygote advantage can maintain a balanced polymorphism, using the sickle cell allele as an example
* Why is lactose tolerance a polymorphic trait
* Humans are a polytopic species. How does this help explain why anthropologists now prefer to explain the skin color polymorphism in terms of clinal variation rather than race

### Human Variation
* Population-level variation vs. individual variation

### Population Genetics
* Genetic variation within/between populations: *Polymorphisms*
* A population that has 2+ alleles for a gene (or 2+ phenotypes for a trait) is *polymorphic* for that gene/trait

### Polymorphism: ABO Blood Type System
* Frequencies of A, B, AB and O phenotypes vary across the world
* Different phenotypes exhibit different resistance to disease

#### Maternal-fetal incompatibility
* ABO and Rhesus(Rh) blood type systems RH = +/-
   * Babies with + if mother has - and vice versa are much more likely to be debilitatingly anemic
* Mother does not possess a red blood cell antigen, but fetus does
* Mother’s body will make antibodies against the fetus’s antigen
* First pregnancy OK, *next* ones risk miscarriage or anemia
* Against the blood type *polymorphism*
* If Natural selection had its way, all humans would have the same blood type, humans have just gotten around that somehow I wasn’t really paying attention (this was when Jack made the rhesus blood joke)

### Balanced Polymorphism: sickle cell disease
* Recessive Inheritance
* Found in higher than expected frequencies in certain populations
* Balanced polymorphism natural selection prevents alleles from becoming fixed/lost
   * Fixed - everyone in population has it
   * Lost - nobody has it
* Heterozygotes have a selective advantage over homozygotes
   * Better chance of survival
   * The means by which a balanced polymorphism is maintained
* RBCs deliver oxygen to body tissues
* Hemoglobin (protein)
   * 4 polypeptide chains (2 matching alpha + 2 beta)
* Point Mutation on beta chain results in sickle cell trait
* Sickle cell attacks: RBCs distort after oxygen is dropped off -> “traffic jam”
* HbAHbA = Homozygous, normal
* HbAHbS = heterozygous, sickle cell trait
   * Co-dominant
* HbSHbS = homozygous, sickle cell anemia
   * Leading cause of death in NCAA football players
* High frequencies of sickle cell allele + high occurences of a very fatal form of malaria
* Vector: mosquitoes
* Sickle cell allele (HbS) occurs in ALL populations
* Heterozygote advantage

##### How to decrease malaria parasites
* Kill mosquitoes (DDT)
* Interrupt parasite’s life-cycle (drugs)
* **Make host’s body inhospitable to parasite**

##### Balanced polymorphism: sickle cell disease (jesus she’s been on this for 40 minutes)
* 2000 years ago, central Africa
* Slash-and-burn agriculture
   * Lots of standing water which mosquitoes treat like a love hotel
* New mosquito vector for malaria
* “Bad” mutation turned “good” (in some areas)
* Genetic equilibrium between allele’s costs and benefits
* Where falciparum malaria is endemic, up to 10% of the population are carriers of HbS
* Heterozygote advantage: greater resistance (not immunity!) to malaria

##### Lactase Polymorphism
* Mammals typically lose the ability to digest lactose when production of lactase enzyme ceases
* *diarying* population continue to produce lactase through adulthood
* It’s “normal” to be lactose intolerant
* Lactase persistence allele = dominant
* Lactose tolerant and intolerant people produce identical lactase enzymes
* Difference in regulatory genes: regulate *timing* of lactase synthesis
* Nomadic pastoralists of North Africa and Arabia: fresh milk as critical food resource
* Northern Europe: milk products help prevent vitamin D deficiency

##### Skin Color Polymorphism
* Selection pressure: exposure to ultraviolet radiation
* High UVR: (Dark Skin Color)
   * Equator, tropics
   * More melanin -> protection from sunburn, skin cancer, folic acid breakdown
      * Deficiencies in folic acid during pregnancy can cause birth defects
         * spina bifida - could be fatal
* Light Skin Color
   * Northern Latitudes
   * Less eumelanin -> more efficient vitamin D synthesis
   * Rickets
