        and answer research questions

      > What is Culture?
        > A set of learned behavior traditions
        > Ways of behaving valuing and thinking
          > Socially transmitted and learned
        > possessed by other animal species
      > Evolution
        > A change in the frequency of a particular trait, and the genes that
          control it, from one generation to the next.
      > Scientific Method
        > A process, not a result
        > Questions that can be repeated and verified by experimentation
        > 4 basic steps
          > observation
          > hypothesis formation
          > experimentation and data collection
          > conclusion
      > Scientific Theory
        > A hypothesis supported by lots of observation and experimentation
        > Most widely accepted, plausible explanation
        > Science as self-correcting
        > Example: Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection
      > Human Origins: Competing explanations
        > Creationism or Intelligent Design vs Evolution
          > Creationism vs Intelligent Design
            > Creationism: Bible story, no evolution
            > Intelligent Design: Evolution was directed by God
          > Valid religious beliefs but can't be tested or proven by science

      > Carolus Linnaeus
        > 1707-1778
        > Taxonomy
        > Hierarchal placement of animals into descending categories based on
          shared features
          > Categories get more and more specific as they descend
        > Binomial nomenclature:
          > Genus Species
            > Humans are Homo Sapiens
            > Gorillas are Gorilla Gorilla
      > Jean Baptist de Lamarck
        > 1744-1829
        > Relationship between an animals biology and way of life
          > Adaptation and all that (but he didn't really figure that out)
        > Theory of Inheritance of Acquired characteristics
        > Changes acquired in each generation are passed down to the next
      > Charles Lyell (1797-1875)
        > Earth as dynamic
          > Theory of uniformitarianism
            > Natural laws are constant
            > Change usually occurs slowly and steadily
            > Change is non-progressive
      > Charles Darwin
        > (1809-1882)
        > Had a "vomit basin"
        > Co-developer with Alfred Russel Wallace of the theory of evolution
          by Natural Selection
        > Friendship with John Edmonstone
          > Unhappy student at Edinburgh University
          > Learned taxidermy from Edmonstone, a former slave
          > Inspired by stories of South American flora and fauna
        > Darwin went on a voyage to chart the South American coastline
          > H.M.S. Beagle from 1831-1836
            > Darwin collected plant and animal samples
              > This was his first visit to the Galapagos Islands
          > Results of the Beagle voyage
            > Darwin gained buzz
            > Specimens studied by specialists
            > 12 species of Galapagos finches
            > Adaptive Radiation
              > Adaptations and new species "radiate" from the original
          > Further Revelations
            > Different species on different islands
              > new species not seen before
            > Extinct fossil species in same area as living versions
            > Species change, one into another
      > Variation and Adaptation
        > Individuals vary in all of their traits
        > Traits that give an animal a better chance of reaching adulthood in
          its environment are more adaptive
          > Fitness
            > An animal must reach sexual maturity to reproduce and pass on adaptive
              traits to the next generation
      > Theory of evolution by natural selection
        > Variation
        > fitness
        > Adaptation
          > Differential fitness across generations -> natural selection
          > Trait frequencies change across generations -> Evolution
        > Waiting

            the Original Type"
