Between the urban core of early states, and the hinterlands of the same time period, I would prefer to live in the hinterlands. More so because of the drawbacks of urban cities at the time, rather than any advantages of living in the Hinterlands. My reasoning for not wanting to live in an urban center mostly stems from accounts describing urban populations, pre-sanitation revolution, that had incredibly high mortality rates from rapidly spreading diseases (145, note 6). The urban centers had these high mortality rates because of issues that were unique to urban centers, and while the populations were slowly building immunities as the diseases became endemic (126), there was still a life away from such pathogens in the Hinterlands. That isn't to say that the hinterlands are without issues of their own, but largely hinterland issues can be self-regulated or managed. The hinterlands, being a sort of "wild west" (in the sense that the term is used now, they weren't necesarrily in the west), were ruled over by barbarians, and so a life there was not always guaranteed to be peaceful or calm. To address it more personally, I prefer a life of travel, and while places like the hinterlands don't exactly lend themselves to a leisurely vacation, and ceratinly wouldn't have at the time, it would be a more excited life and one I believe I would enjoy. City life would be unsanitary and dangerous in that sense, while life in the Hinterlands would be dangreous differently.
