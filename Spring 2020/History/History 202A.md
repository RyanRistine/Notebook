# History 202

## Lecture 2/27

### Early Modern Trade
* Regular, ongoing contact among differen tparts of the world, and commercial trade intensifies like never before
* Gradual reorientation of global power as European commercial empures grow stronger
* Key Relationship between imperial states and new welath created by the growth in commercial trade

### Colonies
* Societies organized from the ground-up to produce commodities for oher people's consumption, enriching the imperial state in the process.

### Potosi
* Rich as FUCK from silver
	* Doubloons became popular around the fucking world VERY fast (at least for early history standards)
		* Doubloons = first world currency
			* went to china first because they were big an powerful
	* 85% of the worlds silver and 75% of the worlds gold came from the Americas at this time
* Many cities in South America are based around massive pit mines
* First major commodity to be hsipped out of South America was Brazilwood - (how brazil got its name)
	* peeps were like "oh shit that wood is like red and cool and shit"

### Portugal?
* Seafaring
* relied heavily on navy
* Fertile land along coast
* sugar plantations
* Used slave labor
	* not the first time in history
		* canary islands used by spain as "testing grounds" for slave plantations
### Not sure topic
* Between 1492 and 17something 40%? were slaves 40% of which went to brazil, 40% in carribean, 5% in what is today the United States

### Things that make him sleep better at night
* of the slaves that were brought to the new world, not all of them lived and died on a plantaiton, lots of africans bought as slaves, escaped and formed communities of up to 10,000 people in the middle of the Amazon rainforest

### Vasco de Gama (1469-1524) Portuguese explorer
* rounds ape of good hope 1497
* skirts southern tip of Africa, stopping at various ports along the way
* Got into lots of shootouts, specifically in mozambique and mombasa
	* then takes some ambassasdor type dude hostage

### Ahmad Ibn Majid
* Well known navigator for de Gama
	* de Gama relied on this dude like we rely on google maps

### They ships were dope af
* CANNONS GO BOOM people saw cannons and were like "oh shit"
* Beginning of the era of armed trade

### De Gama was kinda a badass
* Conquered mad shit, killed mad peeps, took names, etc.
* kinda fucked over cities like venice by flooding the market with pepper
* WENT FUCKIN HAM IN CALICUT ROUND 2 THEY GOT FUCKED

* ***Cartaz*** == trade license

### Spanish Diplomacy
* did not exist
* they tried to take over china VERY VERY Poorly
* china: "what could the Europeans possibly offer us that we don't already have"

### History is badass
* China fucked europeans, fucking bent them all the way over jesus fuck
	* dismembered them then rolled their bodies in animal dung

### Portuguese model of armed trading
* had some power to get them a foothold, but was definitely limited

## Lecture 3/03

### European Colonial Expansion
* Colonies in the Americas, established by various countries that sent explorers to the new world
	* became generators of large wealth for their respective dynastic monarchies
* New Trade routes in and around the Indian Ocean expanded and became increibly valuable to the Europeans
	* Europeans mostly used ports for trading though

* The Dutch establish an outpost in Batavia (now jakarta, capital of Indonesia)
	* attaching Labor to Commodities "american style colony"
		* slave labor, Africans and Javans
	* Had canals/channels connecting Ocean and port to the rest of the city
#### Indian Ocean Trade
* Key Word: ***Entrepots*** another word for commercial ports
	* a port city designed for commercial transactions
		* has forts, warehouses, historically where arab traders would've over seen transactions, but increasingly the portuguese, Dutch, and british would take over
	* Hormuz in Persia was a chokepoint and entrepots
		* had an "early modern costco" or emporium: a large retail store selling a wide variety of goods
		* no access to fresh water, isolated in that respect
			* and yet had a growing population
	* Aden in Arabia, chokepoint and Entrepot, had a fort and all that jazz
		* No access to freshwater or  even arable ladnd
			* subsisted exclusively through trade, indicitive of a change in the world to one that is more dependent

* Dependence on trade was strength and vulnerability
	* strength, could trade for weapons etc
	* vulnerability, they could be cut off and doomed

#### Southeast Asia
* Became a war zone
* various trade involved empires fought for control over the incredibly lucrative region.
* Piracy became much more prevalent as these trade routes became more and more economically advantageous
	* Imagine pirating stuff that'd be AWFUL who would do that
* Through economic warfare, longstanding arab merchants challenged and exposed vulnerablities in the new trade networks from Europe

### The Dutch East India Company and other market companies like it I forget the general word
* would have monopoloy licenses granted from monarchies
* pact between private trade entrepeneurs and the monarchy
* Fonuded in 1602
* designed to combat the manipulation of commodity prices by arab traders, as well as to defend trade routes and ships from pirates
* main point though was to increase production
	* increase in production = huge commercial fleet
		* dutch had 250 vessels, largest fleet to protect trade and transport goods
	* larger profits to overcome the costs of transport
* A precursor to larger corporations
* Key Word: ***Mercantilism*** The philosophy and practice undergirding European trade in the ealy modern global economy.
	* 1. Trade for profit within a closed system
	* 2. Viewed the world's wealth as fixed
	* 3. Colonies, increasingly corporate owned

* Factories = Portuguese term
	* produce single commodities
	* started as "Factorias" institutions where enslaved africans were brought traded, and loaded onto ships
	* The beginnings of the assembly line type deal, one person does one specific part of production

### Production
* increases and communities spring up around creating commodities for the consumption of others

### Growth of Wealth
* As wealth grows in Europe it increases potential for investment
* First stock market in amsterdam in 1602
	* companies themselves become commodities
* Insurance Companies emerge at these European Markets
* Speculators also energe
* south sea bubble 1720
	* first major overvaluation
	* term bubble is still used today

## Lecture 3/05

### Key Themes from Unit 1
* State formation
* Global Trade
* Environmental Change
* All these ^ were/are intertwined

### State Formation
* The process of the formation of a centralized government structure
* state formation is not new during the development of the modern world
* the notion that states were historically bastions of luxury, culture, and opportunity
* states engaged in bondage and slavery to keep people in the cities
	* These states were controlling, the concept of liberty/opportunity wasn't as cookie cutter and perfect as it may seem
		* especially for women, they look Ls
	* Many people who moved from villages to cities, moved to their own detriment
		* "cities were places people went to die"
* At the beginning of state formation, it might have been better to live a nomadic lifestyle

### Empire building
* Effort by a state to extend its control over a geographically expansive area
	* some soveigernty

#### Typology of Empire
* Agrarian Empire
* Trading Empire
* Mercantilist Empire
* Ming China, Hapsburgs (Spain), Ottomans, Portuguese, Dutch, and English

#### Agrarian
* Farming for subsistence
* miniscule urban elite would skim off the top for their own consumption
* Main point is controlling territory that can be cultivated to produce surpluses that in turn produce excess and wealth which thusly allows the state to continue to expand its power

##### Ming China
* Began as a trading empire but eventually turned inward and became an Agrarian Society

#### trading
* Rely on revenue from taxing commercial trade and activity
* less about expansive territory, more about strategic placement of territory
	* ports, choke points

##### Ottoman Empire
* Power rested in control of trade routes across central Asia
	* controlled important choke points
* Also some conquest
* mainly depended on commerce

##### Portuguese
* Selling trading licenses "cartaz" to make money off of new trade

#### Mercantilist
* rely on trade and taxation
* drivers of this state system, key actors, are merchant capitalists backed by monarchs
* new class of people enriched by trade, who pursue their own private interests, while still working with monarchs
* engaged in corporate colonization
	* building overseas colonies
	* specialized in production and mass production
* Wealth begins to pool, corporations begin to become valued as a commodity (beginning of stock and modern corporations)
* power comes from capital (money/resources) itself

##### Hapsburgs (Spain)
* Established colonies in the Americas
	* Sugar production and other specialized Production
* At home in Spain, was still largely Agrarian

##### Dutch
* Started first major corporation, Dutch East India trading company
	* intended to protect against the risks involved with long distance trade and commerce
* Established capital markets, first stock market in Amsterdam, for the purpose of generating revenue to support their efforts
* Built largest fleet the world had ever known
* Bought Insurance policies to protect them
* incredibly productive and valuable colonies, such as among other, spices in Indonesia

### Trade
* Before 1492 started with high value to bulk ratio goods
* introduction of sea trade in the indian ocean, larger vessels, larger range of goods, with less value to bul ratio
* trade afteer 1492 intensified and globalized
	* especially due to colonies becoming increasingly common, and productive
* Triangular Trade
	* the flow of commodities and the effort to produce them across the sea
* "flavor came from one continent, capital came from another, and land came from another, triangular trade"
* as trade increased, people could invest, buy bonds/stocks

### Environmental Change
* At the beginning of development of modern world, Agrarian subsistence based societies were common
* Despite the development of trade and commerce, agriculture was still dominant
* Crop production in early modern world was limited
	* due to nitrogen cycle
		* as farming continues, the ground becomes less fertile due to less nitrogen and so less people can be sustained by agriculture in an area
	* use of fertilizer and crop rotation somewhat contributed to allowing for more production
	* making more room was by far the best way of creating more food
		* deforestation was present before 1492 in china to create room to plant rice
* "there was a limit on the energy available to live"
* Urbanization was a source of Environmental change in the early modern period
* Environmental change intensified following 1492
	* sometimes intentional
		* colonies being built overseas, increasing trade and commerce, and changing ecosystems by bringing plants and animals from their homes to places where they became invasive species
		* the exchange of commodities such as maize/corn in places in Africa was largely transformative both for Africa and the Americas
	* Less intentional
	 	* the invasive species thing actually belongs here, future Ryan, pretend it's in the right place please
		* demographic collapse of indigenous populations of the Americans
			* largely due to new European diseases
				* killed off up to 95% of Native American population
			* Native American populations that previously had large impacts on their surroundings were relatively quickly wiped out, and some reversion of nature occurred
				* Europeans in 1650 thought that it was a brand new wilderness because the land had grown back so strongly

### The Global Crisis of the Seventeenth Century
* Europe (engulfed in war)
* Mughal Empire (india, erosion of central authority due to changes in local economy prescipitated by, among others, vasco de gama)
* China (ming beginning to lose its grip on power, emperor was secluded in the forbidden city, unconcerned, possibly unaware, of the famine that surrounded him in his empire)

#### Europe, Mercantilist Warfare
* Intense rivalries among merchant systems in Europe
* One of the theaters of Mercantilist wars was the Caribbean, states fighting over land and colonies that would be financially viable in the future
* "whoever controls the Caribbean controls the destiny of European states"
* these states were costly
	* European states generated capital and resources to fund their warfare from private interests, merchant capitalists, purchasing bonds or investing in the stock markets
	* states profit off of their people

##### St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre (August 24, 1572)
	* took place, sadly, during a wedding between siblings of two families, one catholic and one protestant
		* catholic crowds were opposed and rampaged through streets of Paris, killing French protestants
			* men, women, and children, no mercy no remorse
			* 3,000 dead in Paris alone, 10,000 more in the hinterlands of Paris

#### Expansion of the Mughal empire (1557-1707)
* story of gradual decline and authority becoming less respected and powerful
* established and expressed its power in a number of ways
	* nuptual alliances - combining households, bonds between families
	* Wealth drawn from the Agrarian parts of the empire, taxation of agriculture
* different from Europe in that it was pluralistic
	* lots of religions
* flexed insane amounts of drip to express their power - "Peacock Throne"
	* Like actually ridiculously impressive
* Taj Mahal
	* A tomb for one of Akbar the great's wives

##### Deccan Wars (1680-1707)
* Wide trade reaches increased conflict between Europeans (Portuguese) and Mughal Empire

#### British East India Trading Company
* Led by military leaders in the European state as well as emerging capitalists and aspiring entrepreneurs
	* Goal was industrial colonization of India, in search of cotton

#### Ming Dynasty (1368-1644)
* global trade brought great prosperity
	* fall happened over time
* limited trade with outsiders, main focus of empire was agricultural production
* increasingly after 1492, ming financial system was dependent on silk to keep it ticking along
	* Most of American silver ended up in China
* Turkeys were pets in ming china
	* made possible by this early economy where you could bring an American turkey to China
* private libraries flourished in ming China
* why did the ming dynasty fall?
	* closing of the spigot of silver in the 17th century
		* circulation of silver globally slowed down, almost came to a halt
	* Prevalence and expansion of global trade gave an economic external shock to the system
	* Piracy increased the cost of long term trade
	* states that previously served as a inlet for silver to china were no longer friends
		* manila and some other place were controlled by spain and portugal nad became enemies and stopped talking to eachother and so China stopped benefitting from their friendship
	* Zhu Yijun, Emperor (1572-1620) lots of famine, starvation
		* caused a civil war
			* some rebel forces became so powerful they could take on the ming imperial army
				* Li Zicheng, a shepered, led an army of 250k strong that fucked shit up, took beijing
				* my man Zhu Yijung hung himself
