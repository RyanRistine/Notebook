### Early Modern Trade 
* Regular, ongoing contact among differen tparts of the world, and commercial trade intensifies like never before
* Gradual reorientation of global power as European commercial empures grow stronger
* Key Relationship between imperial states and new welath created by the growth in commercial trade

### Colonies 
* Societies organized from the ground-up to produce commodities for oher people's consumption, enriching the imperial state in the process. 

### Potosi
* Rich as FUCK from silver
	* Doubloons became popular around the fucking world VERY fast (at least for early history standards) 
		* Doubloons = first world currency
			* went to china first because they were big an powerful
	* 85% of the worlds silver and 75% of the worlds gold came from the Americas at this time
* Many cities in South America are based around massive pit mines
* First major commodity to be hsipped out of South America was Brazilwood - (how brazil got its name)
	* peeps were like "oh shit that wood is like red and cool and shit"

### Portugal?
* Seafaring
* relied heavily on navy
* Fertile land along coast
* sugar plantations
* Used slave labor
	* not the first time in history
		* canary islands used by spain as "testing grounds" for slave plantations
### Not sure topic
* Between 1492 and 17something 40%? were slaves 40% of which went to brazil, 40% in carribean, 5% in what is today the United States

### Things that make him sleep better at night
* of the slaves that were brought to the new world, not all of them lived and died on a plantaiton, lots of africans bought as slaves, escaped and formed communities of up to 10,000 people in the middle of the Amazon rainforest 

### Vasco de Gama (1469-1524) Portuguese explorer
* rounds ape of good hope 1497
* skirts southern tip of Africa, stopping at various ports along the way 
* Got into lots of shootouts, specifically in mozambique and mombasa
	* then takes some ambassasdor type dude hostage

### Ahmad Ibn Majid

* WENT FUCKIN HAM IN CALICUT ROUND 2 THEY GOT FUCKED

* ***Cartaz*** == trade license

### Spanish Diplomacy

### History is badass
* China fucked europeans, fucking bent them all the way over jesus fuck
	* dismembered them then rolled their bodies in animal dung

### Portuguese model of armed trading
* had some power to get them a foothold, but was definitely limited

## Lecture 3/03

### European Colonial Expansion
* Colonies in the Americas, established by various countries that sent explorers to the new world
	* became generators of large wealth for their respective dynastic monarchies
* New Trade routes in and around the Indian Ocean expanded and became increibly valuable to the Europeans
	* Europeans mostly used ports for trading though

* The Dutch establish an outpost in Batavia (now jakarta, capital of Indonesia)
	* attaching Labor to Commodities "american style colony"
		* slave labor, Africans and Javans
	* Had canals/channels connecting Ocean and port to the rest of the city
#### Indian Ocean Trade
* Key Word: ***Entrepots*** another word for commercial ports
	* a port city designed for commercial transactions
		* has forts, warehouses, historically where arab traders would've over seen transactions, but increasingly the portuguese, Dutch, and british would take over
	* Hormuz in Persia was a chokepoint and entrepots
		* had an "early modern costco" or emporium: a large retail store selling a wide variety of goods
		* no access to fresh water, isolated in that respect
			* and yet had a growing population
	* Aden in Arabia, chokepoint and Entrepot, had a fort and all that jazz
		* No access to freshwater or  even arable ladnd 
			* subsisted exclusively through trade, indicitive of a change in the world to one that is more dependent 

* Dependence on trade was strength and vulnerability
	* strength, could trade for weapons etc
	* vulnerability, they could be cut off and doomed

#### Southeast Asia
* Became a war zone
* various trade involved empires fought for control over the incredibly lucrative region.
* Piracy became much more prevalent as these trade routes became more and more economically advantageous 
	* Imagine pirating stuff that'd be AWFUL who would do that
* Through economic warfare, longstanding arab merchants challenged and exposed vulnerablities in the new trade networks from Europe

### The Dutch East India Company and other market companies like it I forget the general word
* would have monopoloy licenses granted from monarchies
* pact between private trade entrepeneurs and the monarchy
* Fonuded in 1602
* designed to combat the manipulation of commodity prices by arab traders, as well as to defend trade routes and ships from pirates 
* main point though was to increase production
	* increase in production = huge commercial fleet
		* dutch had 250 vessels, largest fleet to protect trade and transport goods
	* larger profits to overcome the costs of transport
* A precursor to larger corporations 
* Key Word: ***Mercantilism*** The philosophy and practice undergirding European trade in the ealy modern global economy.
	* 1. Trade for profit within a closed system
	* 2. Viewed the world's wealth as fixed
	* 3. Colonies, increasingly corporate owned

* Factories = Portuguese term
	* produce single commodities
	* started as "Factorias" institutions where enslaved africans were brought traded, and loaded onto ships 
	* The beginnings of the assembly line type deal, one person does one specific part of production

### Production
* increases and communities spring up around creating commodities for the consumption of others

### Growth of Welath
* As wealth grows in Europe it increases potential for investment
* First stock market in amsterdam in 1602
	* companies themselves become commodities 
* Insurance Companies emerge at these European Markets
* Speculators also energe
* south sea bubble 1720
	* first major overvaluation
