While Native Americans are commonly presumed to have been very resectful, and in tune with their surrounding environments, this was not always the case. Native American tribes and populations did not have the same sophisticated understanding of the environment as we have now, which led them to make several mistakes when it came to maintaing the health of the environment in which they lived. This is evidenced by the Cahokia people people who made up a very large civilization in what is now Illinois. The Cahokian people, while an advanced culture for their time, did not have excellent ecological practices, evidence suggests that they greatly damaged their environment through their logging practices. Logging of trees on bluffs near their land led to increased erosion that went unchecked and caused crop fields to become too marshy, and unusable for their staple crop, corn. Additionally, their logging missteps led to the diminishing of nearby forests as well, which in turn damages the ecosystem by removing the homes of the various animals that resided in the forests. Other civilizations have also enacted change upon their environments with long lasting effects that could possibly still have influence on the environment today. Researchers from the Univerity of Texas worked to analyze new and old data, examining the effects that the Mayan civilization had on their environment. The researchers went as far as to refer to the Mayan civilization as the "mayacene", a microcosm of the Anthropocene that many believe we are currently in. This illustrates the large-scale impact that the Mayans had, for researchers to assign that type of name suggests that the impact was not small. The researchers made sure to stress that the environmental impact wasn't all positive or negative though, rather a mix of both, illustrating that the mayan relationshup with nature wasnt all bad.
