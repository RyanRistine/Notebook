# Astronomy 100

## Lecture 1/28

### How big is the milky way?
* 100 billion stars  
* 100,000 light years across  
* Stars orbit within the galaxy which takes ~250 million years  
### Is there life elsewhere in the Universe?
* There's amino acids in clouds in space
* Water and possible evidence of microbes on mars
* Probably
  * 1.6 x 10^22 is a LOT of planets
  * We haven't seen them or any evidence but there's almost no way there
  isn't other life somewhere
### How old is the Universe
* 13.8 Billion years
* The Cosmic Calendar
  * The Life of the Universe compacted into a year
  * Big Bang at January 1
  * Milky Way galaxy formed in May
  * Our Solar System forms in September, beginning of Life on Earth
  * Earth's atmosphere becomes oxygenated in October
  * Complex life appears in November
  * Humans came into the Universe on December 31
  * December
    * 19
    * Vertebrates appear
    * 20 Land plants appear
    * 25 dinosaurs appear
    * 26 Mammals appear
    * 30 Dinosaurs go extinct
    * 31 Humans appear
      * Humans evolve at 23:58
      * 23:59:35 Agriculture arises
      * 23:59:49 Pyramids Built
      * 23:59:59 Kepler and Galileo show that Earth orbits the Sun
### The Nature of Science
* The word theory has a different meaning in science than in everyday life
in science a theory is not he same as a hypothesis, rather:
  * A scientific theory must:
    * Explain a wide variety of observations with a few simple principles AND
      * must be supported by a large compelling body of evidence
      * must not have failed any crucial test of its validity
* A scientific model must make testable predictions
  * "real" scientists try to disprove their hypotheses
## Lecture 1/30
### Discovering the Universe for yourself
* Patterns in the sky
* Motions in the sky
  * The Circling Sky
    * The rotation of the Earth about its axis
  * The Moon, Our Constant Companion
    * The Moon's orbit around the Earth
  * The Reason for Seasons
    * The Earth's orbit around the Sun
  * Precession of the Earth's Axis
    * The wobbling of Earth's axis
* A constellation is
  * A region of the sky, within official borders set by the International
    Astronomical Union
  * Often recognizable by a pattern or grouping of stars
  * Pretty meaningless
* The Celestial Sphere
  * The sky above looks like a dome...a hemisphere..
  * If we imagine the sky around the entire Earth, we have the celestial sphere
  * This is a 2-dimensional representation of the sky
  * The Earth is the center of the sphere
  * North and South celestial poles
    * the points in the sky directly above the Earth's North and South poles
  * celestial equator
    * the extension of the Earth's equator onto the celestial sphere
  * *ecliptic*
    * the annual path of the Sun through the celestial sphere, which is a
      projection of ecliptic plane

### The Milky Way

* Our Galaxy is shaped like a disc
* Our solar system is in that disk
* When we look up the Milky Way is in the sky

### The Local Sky

* Zenith
  * The point directly above you
  * The sun is never directly overhead
    * The sun can only be directly overhead in an area of Earth called the tropics
* Nadir
  * The point directly beneath your feet
* Horizon
  * All points 90 degrees from the zenith
* Altitude
  * the angle above the horizon
* Meridian
  * due north horizon => zenith => Due south horizon

### The Daily Motion

* As the Earth rotates, the sky appears to us to rotate in the opposite direction.
* The sky appears to rotate around the N (or S) celestial poles.
* If you are standing at the poles, nothing rises or sets.
* The altitude of the celestial pole = your latitude
* All stars at an angle less than you latitude away from:
  * Your celestial pole never set. (circumpolar)
  * the other celestial pole. are never seen by you
* Other stars, (and the Sun, Moon & planets) rise in East and set in West

### Annual Motion

* The Earth's Axis is tilted 23.5 degrees from being perpendicular to the ecliptic plane.
* Therefore, the celestial equator is tilted 23.5 degrees to the ecliptic
* As seen from Earth, the Sun spends 6 months north of the celestial equator and 6 months south of the celestial equator.
* **Seasons are caused by the Earth's axis tilt *not* the distance from the Earth to the Sun!**

### The Cause of the Seasons

* Spring Equinox
  * Sun shines equally on both hemispheres
* Winter Solstice
  * Northern Hemisphere receives least direct sunlight of the year
* Fall Equinox
  * Sun shines equally on both hemispheres
* Summer Solstice
  * Northern Hemisphere receives its most direct sunlight of the year

## Lecture 2/4

### The Moon, Our Constant Companion

##### Lunar Motion
* Phases of the Moon's 29.5 day cycle
  * Waxing
    * New
    * Crescent
    * First Quarter
    * Gibbous
    * Full
  * Waning
    * Gibbous
    * Last Quarter
    * Crescent
    * New

#### Why Do We See Phases?
* Half the Moon illuminated by Sun and half is dark
* We see some combination of the bright and dark faces

#### Why do we see the same face?
* Rotation Period = Orbital Period

#### Eclipses
* The Earth & Moon cast shadows
* When either passes through the other's shadow, we have an eclipse
  * Total Solar Eclipse happens only w/ a new moon
    * Within umbra: Total solar Eclipse
    * within penumbra: Partial solar eclipse
  * Total Lunar Eclipse happens only w/ a full moon
    * Everyone on the nighttime side of earth can see it

### Pseudo-Science
* A spurious or pretended science; a branch of knowledge or a system of beliefs
  mistakenly regarded as based on scientific method or having the status of
  scientific truth
