* Stars orbit within the galaxy which takes ~250 million years  
### Is there life elsewhere in the Universe?
* There's amino acids in clouds in space
* Water and possible evidence of microbes on mars
* Probably
  * 1.6 x 10^22 is a LOT of planets
  * We haven't seen them or any evidence but there's almost no way there
  isn't other life somewhere
### How old is the Universe
* 13.8 Billion years
* The Cosmic Calendar
  * The Life of the Universe compacted into a year
  * Big Bang at January 1
  * Milky Way galaxy formed in May

  * December
    * 19
    * Vertebrates appear
    * 20 Land plants appear
    * 25 dinosaurs appear
    * 26 Mammals appear

      * 23:59:59 Kepler and Galileo show that Earth orbits the Sun
### The Nature of Science
* The word theory has a different meaning in science than in everyday life
in science a theory is not he same as a hypothesis, rather:
  * A scientific theory must:
    * Explain a wide variety of observations with a few simple principles AND
      * must be supported by a large compelling body of evidence
      * must not have failed any crucial test of its validity
* A scientific model must make testable predictions
  * "real" scientists try to disprove their hypotheses
## Lecture 1/30
### Discovering the Universe for yourself
* Patterns in the sky
* Motions in the sky
  * The Circling Sky
    * The rotation of the Earth about its axis
  * The Moon, Our Constant Companion
    * The Moon's orbit around the Earth
  * The Reason for Seasons
    * The Earth's orbit around the Sun
  * Precession of the Earth's Axis
    * The wobbling of Earth's axis
* A constellation is
  * A region of the sky, within official borders set by the International
    Astronomical Union
  * Often recognizable by a pattern or grouping of stars
  * Pretty meaningless
* The Celestial Sphere
  * The sky above looks like a dome...a hemisphere..
  * If we imagine the sky around the entire Earth, we have the celestial sphere
  * This is a 2-dimensional representation of the sky
  * The Earth is the center of the sphere
  * North and South celestial poles
    * the points in the sky directly above the Earth's North and South poles
  * celestial equator
    * the extension of the Earth's equator onto the celestial sphere
  * *ecliptic*
    * the annual path of the Sun through the celestial sphere, which is a
      projection of ecliptic plane

### The Milky Way

* Our Galaxy is shaped like a disc
* Our solar system is in that disk
* When we look up the Milky Way is in the sky

### The Local Sky

* Zenith
  * The point directly above you
  * The sun is never directly overhead
    * The sun can only be directly overhead in an area of Earth called the tropics
* Nadir
  * The point directly beneath your feet
* Horizon
  * All points 90 degrees from the zenith
* Altitude
  * the angle above the horizon
* Meridian
  * due north horizon => zenith => Due south horizon

### The Daily Motion

* As the Earth rotates, the sky appears to us to rotate in the opposite direction.
* The sky appears to rotate around the N (or S) celestial poles.
* If you are standing at the poles, nothing rises or sets.
* The altitude of the celestial pole = your latitude
* All stars at an angle less than you latitude away from:
  * Your celestial pole never set. (circumpolar)
  * the other celestial pole. are never seen by you
* Other stars, (and the Sun, Moon & planets) rise in East and set in West

### Annual Motion

* The Earth's Axis is tilted 23.5 degrees from being perpendicular to the ecliptic plane.
* Therefore, the celestial equator is tilted 23.5 degrees to the ecliptic
* As seen from Earth, the Sun spends 6 months north of the celestial equator and 6 months south of the celestial equator.
* **Seasons are caused by the Earth's axis tilt *not* the distance from the Earth to the Sun!**

### The Cause of the Seasons

* Spring Equinox
  * Sun shines equally on both hemispheres
* Winter Solstice
  * Northern Hemisphere receives least direct sunlight of the year
* Fall Equinox
  * Sun shines equally on both hemispheres
* Summer Solstice
  * Northern Hemisphere receives its most direct sunlight of the year

## Lecture 2/4

    * Gibbous
    * Full
  * Waning
    * Gibbous
    * Last Quarter
    * Crescent
    * New

#### Why Do We See Phases?
* Half the Moon illuminated by Sun and half is dark
* We see some combination of the bright and dark faces

#### Why do we see the same face?
* Rotation Period = Orbital Period

#### Eclipses
* The Earth & Moon cast shadows
* When either passes through the other's shadow, we have an eclipse
  * Total Solar Eclipse happens only w/ a new moon
    * Within umbra: Total solar Eclipse
    * within penumbra: Partial solar eclipse
  * Total Lunar Eclipse happens only w/ a full moon
    * Everyone on the nighttime side of earth can see it

### Pseudo-Science
* A spurious or pretended science; a branch of knowledge or a system of beliefs
  mistakenly regarded as based on scientific method or having the status of
  scientific truth

## Lecture 2/6

### Moon Topography
* Highlands:
	* More Craters, older (~4.4 Billion Years)
* Mare:
	* Younger, less craters, dark basalt, volcanic in origin

### The Copernican Revolution

#### How Copernicus, Tychom and Kepler challenged the Earth-centered model of the Universe

* Copernicus (1473-1543)
	* Proposed sun-centered model
	* Used model to determine layout of solar system, measured distances in AU, Astonomical Units: the distance between the Sun and the Earth
		* Model wasn't very accuracte in terms of predicting planetary positions
* Tycho Brahe (1546-1601)
	* Complied the most accurate naked eye measurements ever amde of planetary positions at the observatory he built
	* Hired Kepler, who used Tycho's obsercations to discover the truth about planetary motion
* Johannes Kepler (1571-1630)
	* First tried to match Tycho's observations with circular orbit
	* Found an 8-arcminute discrepancy which lef him eventually to make a model of planetary orbits using ellipses
##### Keplers 3 Laws
* 1. The orbit of each planet around the sun is an ellipse with the Sun at one focus
	* very nearly circular but not quite
* 2. As a planet moves around its orbit it sweeps out equal areas in equal times
* 3. More distant planets orbit the Sun at slower average speeds obeying the relationship p^2 = a^3
	* p = orbital period in years
	* a - avg. distance in AU
	* Planets closer to the sun travel faster than those farther from the sun

* Galileo (1564-1642)
	* Overcame major objections to copernican view
		* Key objections were
			* 1. Earth could not be moving because objects in air would be "left behind"
			* 2. Non-circular orbits are not "perfect" as heavens should be
			* 3. All objects orbit the Earth, the "just because" argument
		* Got in lots of legal trouble from angrry conservative catholics because of his claims
	* Overcoming the first objection
		* Galileos experiments showed that objects in air would stay with a moving Earth
			* Aristotle thought all objexts naturally came to rest
			* Galileo showed they sat in motion (wow like Newton's law)
	* Overcoming the second objection
		* Proved that not all cellestial bodies are perfect, for example the moon is really not perfect, craters etc.
	* Overcoming the third objection
		* proved that not all objects orbited Earth by observing the moons of Jupiter
	* Catholic church was really mad with him so they put him under house arrest for not recanting his claims
		* they finally unbanned his book in 1824 and didn't fully vindicate him until 1992

## Lecture 2/11

### Laws of Motion: Understanding Motion, Energy, and Gravity

#### How do we describe motion?
* Speed: Rate at which object moves
	* Speed = distance/time
* Velocity: Combination of speed and direction
	* 10 m/s, due east
* Acceleration: Any change in velocity unit of speed/time (m/s<sup>2</sup>)
* The Acceleration of Gravity (g)
	* All falling objects accelerate at the same rate (not counting friction of air resistance)
	* On Earth G = 9.8m/s<sup>2</sup> speed increases 10m/s with each second of falling.
#### Momentum and Force
* Momentum = mass * velocity
* A **net force** changes momentum, which generally means an acceleration (change in velocity)
	* A force is uaully a change in direction and/or speed  
* How is mass different than weight

| Mass  | The Amount of matter in an object   |
| ----- | ----------------------------------- |
| Weight| The *force* that acts upon an object|
* You are weightless in free-fall
* Why are astronauts weightless in space?
	* There *is* gravity in space
	* Weightlessness is due to a constant stae of free-fall
#### Weightlessness
* Astronauts and other objects inside spacecraft don't fall to the floow of the spacecraft
* The astronauts are accelerating towards Earth, but they are not accelerating towards the floor of the spacecraft
#### How did Newton change our view of the universe?
* Isaac Newton (1642-1727)
* Realized the same physical laws that operate on Eath also operate in the heavens
	* One *Universe*
* Discovered laws of motion and gravity
* Much more: Experiments with light; first reflecting telescope, calculus...
#### Newton's 3 Laws of Motion
* **Newton's First law of motion**: An object moves at a constant velocity unless a net force acts to change its speed or direction
	* *"An object in motion stays in motion, unless acted on by an outside force"*
* **Newton's Second law of motion**: Force = mass * acceleration
* **Newton's Third law of motion**: For every force, there is always an *equal and opposite* reaction force
	* *"For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction"*
	* Example: Wall-E flying around in space with a fire extinguisher
#### Light and Telescopes
##### How do light and matter interact?
* Emission
	* Light leaving matter
* Absorption
	* Light getting absorbed by matter
	* Can be observed by a lack of light being where there otherwise should be light
* Transmisison
	* Transparent objects transmit light
	* Opaque objects block (absorb) light
* Reflection or Scattering
	* Something that reflects will look *"Shiny"* whereas most things that are colorful without being shiny are scattering
		* example of reflecting: Mirror reflects light in a particular direction; why you can see different "perspectives" in a mirror
		* example of scattering: Projector screen, scatters same(relatively) light in all directions
## Lecture 2/13

#### What is light?
* Light can act either like a particle or like a wave
	* Waves contribute to the weird "spikes" coming off lights at night and stuff
* Particles of light are called photons
* A wave is a pattern of motion that can carry energy without carrying matter along with it
* Wavelength is the distance between two wave peaks
* Frequency is the number of times per second that a wave vibrates up and down
* wavelength * frequency = speed of light
* if energy is higher frequency is higher, wavelength is shorter
* we measure the ripples in time and space not from light, but from black holes merging across the universe

* Electromagnetic Spectrum/Radiation - Short to Long wavelength
	* Gamma Rays - highest energy
	* X-rays
	* Ultraviolet
	* Visible Light
	* Infared
		* the longer end of infared is part of "microwaves"
	* radio
		* The first 1/3 or so of radio is part of "microwaves"
### What is the structure of matter?
* Going from "large" to smaller
	* Atom
		* Electron Cloud
			* Nucleus
			* Protons + neutrons
* The different *elements* are differnt atoms distinguished by the number of protons in their nucleus
* *Molecules*: consist of two or more atoms

### How is energy stored in atoms?
* Electrons in atoms are restricted to particularenergy levels or orbits

### Spectrums

* Continuous Spectrum
	* Thermal Spectrum - light coming from how hot something is
	* The spectrum of a common light bullb pan aall visibile wavelengthd
* Emission Line Specturm
	* A low-density cloud of gas emits light only at specific wavelengths that depend on its compostition and temperature, producing a spectrum with bright emission lines
* Absoprtion Line Spectrum
	* A cloud of gas between us and a light bulb can absorb light of specific wabelengths, leaving dark absorption lines in the spectrum

## Lecture 2/17

### Astronomy Picture of the Day
* Betelgeuse is changing
	* Getting Dimmer

### More light stuff

#### Emission Lines
* Each type of ato has a unique set of energy levels
* each transition corresponds to a unique hoton enrgy, frequency, and wavelength #### Maternal-fetal incompatibility

#### Absorption Lines
* Because those atoms can absorb photons with those same energies, upward transitions produce a pattern of absorption lines at the same wavelengths

#### Atoms and Light
* Each type of atom has a unique spectral fingerprint
* Observing the fingerprints in a spectrum tells us which kinds of atoms are present
* Hotter object emit more light at all frequencies per unit area
	* Hotter = Brighter
* Hotter objects emit photons with a higher average energy.
	* Hotter = Bluer
	* Still giving off more red photons
#### How do we know what we know?
* The answer, Light! (electromagnetic Radiation)
* What can we determine with light?
	* Luminosity (brightness)
	* Temperature
	* Composition
	* And much more, (later in the semester) such as ...
	* Speed (Doppler Shift)
	* Rotation Rate (Doppler Shift)
	* Position, distance, mass, age ...

### Chapter 6

* What are the two most important properties of a telescope?
	* Light-collecting area: Telescopes with a larger collecting area can gather a greater amount of light in a shorter range
	* Angular resolution: Telescopes that are larger are capable of taking images with greater detail

#### Angular Resolution
* The minimum angular seperation that the telescope can distinguish
* Astronomers want better *angular resolution* the magnification doesn't matter

### What are the tow basic designs of telescopes?
* **Refracting telescope**: Focuses light with lenses
* **Reflecting telescope**: Focuses light with mirrors

#### Refracting Telescope
* Refractiing telescopes need to be very long, with large, heavy lenses

#### Reflecting Telescope
* Reflecting telescopes can have much greater diameters
* Most modern telescopes are reflectors
	* state of the art is ~the size of seating area in Darwin-03
### Recording Images
* Digital camers detect light with ***Charge-couple devices***
* The inventors of the CCD won the 2009 Nobel Prize in physics
* The CCDs in digital cameras are simliar to those used in modern telescopes

### How does Earth's atmosphere affect ground-based observations?
* The best ground-based sites for astronomical observing are:
	* Calm (not too windy)
	* High (less atmosphere to see through)
	* Dark (far from city lights)
	* Dry (few cloudy nights)  

### Twinkling and Turbulence
* Turbulent air flow in Eath's atmosphere distors our view, causing stars to appear to twinkle
### Adapative Optics
* Rapidly changing the shape of a telescopes mirror compensates for some of the effects of turbulence
## Lecture 2/20
### Transmission in Atmosphere
* Only radio and visible light pass easily through Earth's atmosphere
* we need telescopes in space to observe other forms
* Waves in terms of energy:
	* Gamma and X-Ray = high energy
	* Ultraviolet and visible less energy
	* infared and radio least energy


# Exam 2

## Lecture 2/20

### How does Newton's law of gravity extend Kepler's Laws?
* Newton's laws of gravity and motion showed that the relationship between the orbital period and average orbital dsistance of a system tells us the total mass of the system
* We can "*weigh*" things across the Universe if we can see their orbits

### The Formation of Stars and Planets
* Infared light can get through gas clouds
	* Same phenomenon that turns sunsets red
* Our solar system is only a tiny art of the universe
* Theories of it sorigin must explain the contents: planets, moons, asteroids, etc.
#### The Solar Nebula
* The Solar System formed out of a nebula which collapsed under its own gravity.
* Observational evidence:
	* We observer stars in the process of forming today
	* they are always found within interstellar clouds of gas
* **Solar Nebula** - Name given to the cloud of gas from which our own Solar Sytem formed
* **Molecular cloud** - name given to the densest and ocolset clouds of gas in the interstellar mediu the material between the stars

### Gravitational Collapse
* The Solar Nebula was initially somewhat spherical and a few light years in diameter
	* Very Cold
	* Rotating Slightly
* It was given a "push" by some event
	* Perhaps the shock wave from a nearby supernova
* As the nebula shrank, gravity increased, causing collapse.
* As the nebula "falls" inward, gravitational potential energy is converted to heat
	* conservation of energy
* As the nebula's radius decreases, it rotates faster
	* conservation of Angular Momentum

#### Conservation of Angular Momentum
* angular momentum = mass * Velocity * radius
* The angular momentum of an object cannot change unless an external twisting force (torque) is acting on it
* Angular momentum conservation explains why objext rotate faster as they shrink in radius
	* For example figure skaters

## Lecture 2/25
### Conservation of Angular Momentum cont.
* The angular momentum of a system will be conserved.
* Result: a spinning sphere will become a flattened, rotating disk.
* young stars are surrounded by rotating diss of gas and dust
* The Sun would also have been surorunded.
* The rest of the Solar System formed from that rotating *protoplanetary disk*
* The protostar's energy source is gravitational energy.
* Core's temperature rises as it sinks.
* Hydrogen begins turning into helium in the core
* It becomes a star

### Star or Brown Dwarf?
* Intermediary between planets and stars
* protostar that didn't get big enough to become a star
* The temperature in the core must be hot enough for the nuclear reaction htat turns hydrogen into helium, 10 million kelvin
* Very low-mass stars (<0.8M, M=Mass of the sun) never start that reaction
* These are called brown dwarfs

### Extra-Solar Planets
* They likely exist
* Other stars are distant suns
* Successful theory or formation of our solar system suggests that planetary systems are a natural consequence of star formation
* Why didn't you learn about extrasolar planets in elementary school
	* They're hard to detect
#### Detecting planets is difficult
* A sun like star is a bilion times brighter than the reflected light from a jupiter-like planet
	* Finding a planet is like spotting a moth next to a spotlight
* Angular separation of star and planet is very small
	* stars are so distant that the light from the planet is basically on top of the light from the star
* But over 3850 extrasolar planets have een found in the last fifteen years!

#### How can extrasolar planets be detected?
* Doppler Shift
	* Detect motion of star through its light spectrum, as the star "wobbles" due to the orbiting planet
* Transit method
	* watch a star's brightness drop when it is parially blocked by the orbiting planet
* Direct Detection
	* image the plane titself, by making very sharp images and blocking th light from the star

#### The Doppler Shift Technique
* Depends on:
	* Distance between star and planet
	* Mass of planet
* Planet's tug on star causes starlight to be Doppler Shifted
* Same thing (kinda) as a cop using a radar gun
* because planets have gravitational force (although relatively small compared to the star) that gravity makes stars slightly wobble
	* as it moves, causes waves to "pile up" or blue shift, and vice versa-red shift
#### Measuring Velocity
* Movement away from us shifts the light to longer wavelengths = redshift
* movement towards us shifte the light to shorter wavelengths = blueshift

#### Doppler Limitations
* Easier to detect massive planets close to their star
	* most extrasolar planets discovered this way are more massive than Jupiter, but close to thei star than Earth
	* Massive -> Large Doppler shift
	* Close -> Short orbital periods, seen after a short time
* does this mean that there are no small extrasolor orbiting far from their stars?
	* No, they are harder to detect, but scientists are developing techniques that will look for smaller and smaller planets
* referred to as "*Hot Jupiters*"
	* because they hot and big

#### Transit Technique
* Dark planet passes in front of bright star, star's brightness decreases slightly
* only visible from Earth if we're looking at the orbital plane edge-on
* essentially just tracking brightness over time - dip in brightness = maybe planet

## Lecture 3/03
* APOD: Blue Dolphin Nebula
### Extrasolar planets cont
* TRAPPIST-1 is an Ultracool Dwarf Star much smaller than our Sun
	* Astronomers have noticed dips in TRAPPIST-1's brightness which suggests there are planets around the size of our Earth int its system
	* Some of TRAPPIST's planets are too hot, some are too cold, but three might be just right to have liquid water, a building block of life
		* This region arou na star where liquid water coul dexist is known as the *habitable zone*
### Direct Detection
* Taking pictures of planets instead of detecting them via dips in the light of stars
* Difficult to find earthlike planets using this technique
### Gemini Planet Imager
* GPI was built for one of the world's largest telescopes in order to detect the light from planets orbiting other stars!
	* Complex aaptive optics to make extremely sharp images
### Planetary Atmospheres
#### What is an Atmosphere?
* Layer of gas surrounding a world
* All planets and moons have an atmosphere
	* but some, such as mercury or moon, have such an insignificant atmosphere that they are effectively 'airless"
* Jovian planets are effectively 'all atmosphere"
* Atmospheres of terrestrial worlds and satellites of jovian planets are tiny fraction of total mass
* Atmospheres interact with surface and interior
#### Atmosphere of MArs
* Mostly CO2
* Surface pressure is low
* colder than Earth
#### Atmosphere of Venus
* Surface pressure = 1 km under water on earth
	* you would be crushed if you were on venus' surface
* Surface Temperature = 750K
* CO2 atmosphere with clouds of acid
* Hotter than Mercury
#### Earth's Atmosphere
* Mostly N2 and O2 atmosphere
* lots of water
	* all phases of water are common on Earth
		* liquid
		* gaseous
		* solid
### Astronomy's Important Discovery
* Sunlight warms the planets
* Venus is hotter than Mercury
	* Venus has a Carbon Dioxide "heat blanket" that makes it warmer than it would be without it
* Earth has a Carbon Dioxide in the atmosphere
	* Humans have been putting a lot more Carbon Dioxide in the atmosphere
* As scientifically literature stewards of the Earth, can we understand what is happening and what we can do about it?
### The Environment
* The environment on the Earth depends on the delicate balance between light coming in from the Sun and light escaping back into space.
	* in visible light
	* out infrared light
#### Greenhouse Effect
* Atmosphere makes planet's surface hotter
* Atmosphere transmits visible light, but absorbs infrared light
* planet gets warmer until it emits into space enough infrared light to balance the light it receives from the Sun
* Water, Carbon Dioxide, and Methane are effective greenhouse gases
* think of the Carbon Dioxide we are talking about as a "Heat Blanket" that traps in heat and makes the planet warmer.

## Lecture 3/05

### The Environment Cont
* We've known about the adverse effects on the climate for a while
* Human use of fossil fuels (e.g. oil, gas, and coal) has pumped CO2 into the air
* Human influence is the dominant cause of the observed warming

### Three widely accepted scientific understandings in climate Science
* Carbon dioxide traps heat and exerts major influence on Earth's temperature when its concentration increases or decreases: upheld sine the late 19th century
* Warming of the climate is definitely seen, and many of the observed changes unprecedented over decades to thousands of years.
* Human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.

### What is currently not settled in climate science (as of Today)
* Significant advances have been made on understanding how climate change influences the scale of what matters most to people (e.g. my local rive floodplain, my farm field, the town where my children live, the coastal road along my commute to work,) and predictions from this understanding are still evolving.
* But, incredible progress has been made at modeling and predicting the effects of climate change. See a talk in our own "What Physicists Do" series:
  * EXTREME WEATHER IN A CHANGING CLIMATE
    * https://youtu.be/4c8Hv0p0ePA

### With Global Warming comes
* Sea and Glacial Ice melting
* Raising ocean levels
* Acidification of the ocean
* Flooding
* More intense Hurricanes
* More and more intense wildfires

### What you can do
* Become educated about the problem
* Take Personal action
  * Reduce Energy Use
  * Recycle and Reuse
* Encourage Community action
  * Public Transportation
  * Renewable energy
* Influence U.S. Action 
  * Be an informed and active citizen
  * Hold our leadership accountable
  * Build a clean energy economy
