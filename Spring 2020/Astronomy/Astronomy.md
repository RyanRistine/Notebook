# Astronomy 100
## Lecture 1/28
### How big is the milky way?
* 100 billion stars  
* 100,000 light years across  
* Stars orbit within the galaxy which takes ~250 million years  
### Is there life elsewhere in the Universe?
* There's amino acids in clouds in space
* Water and possible evidence of microbes on mars
* Probably
  * 1.6 x 10^22 is a LOT of planets
  * We haven't seen them or any evidence but there's almost no way there
  isn't other life somewhere
### How old is the Universe
* 13.8 Billion years
* The Cosmic Calendar
  * The Life of the Universe compacted into a year
  * Big Bang at January 1
  * Milky Way galaxy formed in May
  * Our Solar System forms in September, beginning of Life on Earth
  * Earth's atmosphere becomes oxygenated in October
  * Complex life appears in November
  * Humans came into the Universe on December 31
  * December
    * 19
    * Vertebrates appear
    * 20 Land plants appear
    * 25 dinosaurs appear
    * 26 Mammals appear
    * 30 Dinosaurs go extinct
    * 31 Humans appear
      * Humans evolve at 23:58
      * 23:59:35 Agriculture arises
      * 23:59:49 Pyramids Built
      * 23:59:59 Kepler and Galileo show that Earth orbits the Sun
### The Nature of Science
* The word theory has a different meaning in science than in everyday life
in science a theory is not he same as a hypothesis, rather:
  * A scientific theory must:
    * Explain a wide variety of observations with a few simple principles AND
      * must be supported by a large compelling body of evidence
      * must not have failed any crucial test of its validity
* A scientific model must make testable predictions
  * "real" scientists try to disprove their hypotheses
## Lecture 1/30
### Discovering the Universe for yourself
* Patterns in the sky
* Motions in the sky
  * The Circling Sky
    * The rotation of the Earth about its axis
  * The Moon, Our Constant Companion
    * The Moon's orbit around the Earth
  * The Reason for Seasons
    * The Earth's orbit around the Sun
  * Precession of the Earth's Axis
    * The wobbling of Earth's axis
* A constellation is
  * A region of the sky, within official borders set by the International
    Astronomical Union
  * Often recognizable by a pattern or grouping of stars
  * Pretty meaningless
* The Celestial Sphere
  * The sky above looks like a dome...a hemisphere..
  * If we imagine the sky around the entire Earth, we have the celestial sphere
  * This is a 2-dimnesional representation of the sky
  * The Earth is the center of the sphere
  * North and South celestial poles
    * the points in the sky directly above the Earth's North and South poles
  * celestial equator
    * the extension of the Earth's equator onto the celestial sphere
  * *ecliptic*
    * the annual path of the Sun through the celestial sphere, which is a
      projection of ecliptic plane
