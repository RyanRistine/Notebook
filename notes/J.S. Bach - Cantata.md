# J.S. Bach - Cantata

* Nothing like Alessandro Scarlatti's or Barbara Strozzi's Cantatas

## Leipzig, 1723-1750

* This is where he wrote most of his Cantatas
* Probably 40% of the Cantatas he wrote are lost, we have over 200
* Worked at St. Thomas Church - worked at 3 churches at the same time - had TWENTY kids
* Wanted to write Complete Cantata cycles for the entire year
  * Second cycle, dating from 1724-5, bach turned to the concept of a cantata cycle based on a unifying theme. It consists mainly of a series of freshly composed <u>chorale</u> cantatas
    * With this one he started basing his Cantatas on Lutheran chorales so as to unify each individual cantata, as well as unify the writing process.
      * Based around Chorale melodies and their texts

## Lutheran Chorale

* Martin Luther's "Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland" (Now come, savior of the heathens)

* Bach's *Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland*, BWV 62 is in six movements, first and last use first and last of Luther's stanzas.
  * Corno, Oboe, Violono, Viola, Choir: SATB, Organ Continuo Bass
  * Has cool imitation in first movement
